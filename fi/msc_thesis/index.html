title: "Monte Carlo Tree<br> Search in Verification of Markov Decision Processes"
---
$partial("templates/header.html")$

<p>During 2017 I researched how to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search">
  Monte Carlo Tree Search</a>
(a&nbsp;machine learning technique popularized mainly by its success in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero">Go and Chess</a>)
to verify properties of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process">Markov
  Decision Processes</a> (in MDPs you can choose actions but there are
  probabilities influencing where the process goes, see
  <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/casestudies/zeroconf.php">zeroconf</a>
  as an example).

This was a joint work with my advisor
<a href="https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xbrazdil/">Tomáš Brázdil</a>,
<a href="https://www7.in.tum.de/~ashok/">Pranav Ashok</a>, and
<a href="https://www7.in.tum.de/~kretinsk/">Jan Křetínský</a>.
We have managed to come up with algorithms which outperform known
approaches (e.g.,
<a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/bibitem.php?key=FKNP11">value iteration</a>
or
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-11936-6_8">BRTDP</a>)
on some of the
<a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/casestudies/">common benchmarks</a>
and we have shown there are models where our algorithms are
significantly better.
You can read the details in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03299">our paper</a> published in the proceedings of
<a href="http://www.isola-conference.org/isola2018">ISoLA 2018</a>.
