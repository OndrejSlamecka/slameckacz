title: "All Multiway Cuts"
---
$partial("templates/header.html")$

<p>During 2014 and 2015 I implemented and evaluated the
<em>Circuit-Cocircuit</em> algorithm. This algorithm was proposed by <a
href="http://www.fi.muni.cz/~hlineny/">prof. Petr Hliněný</a>  to solve
the problem of generating all minimal multiway edge cuts of a graph.
Besides rather neat theory around it (it's based on ideas from matroid
theory) it also has a practical use, for example <a
href="http://www.cdv.cz/en/">The Transport Research Centre</a> uses this
algorithm for infrastructure planning research.</p>


<p>This research was the topic of my bachelor's thesis and it resulted
in <a href="multicut.pdf">a paper</a> published in LNCS proceedings of
<a href="http://www.memics.cz">MEMICS</a> 2015.
The algorithm implementation with documentation is available at <a
	href="https://github.com/OndrejSlamecka/mincuts">GitHub</a>.</p>
